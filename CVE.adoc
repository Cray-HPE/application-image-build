= CVE Scanning

When system images in this repo are built, a CVE scan is run and the results are saved alongside the image.
These scans can also be run on-demand and the process is documented here.

== OVAL Descriptions from SUSE
SUSE makes available OVAL Descriptions on their site https://www.suse.com/support/security/oval/.
The two files most likely of interest are the `SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15` and `SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 Patches` files.

* https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/oval/suse.linux.enterprise.server.15.xml
* https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/oval/suse.linux.enterprise.server.15-patch.xml

== Tools and Packages
The following packages are installed to enable scanning.

* *scap-security-guide* - https://www.open-scap.org/security-policies/scap-security-guide/
* *openscap* - OpenSCAP package that provides general schema files in `/usr/share/openscap/schemas/`
* *openscap-utils* - OpenSCAP package that provides the applications required for scanning

== Script

On a running system the default script is located in `/srv/cray/scripts/common/openscap.sh` and can be executed from that directory if an internet connection is present.
If internet is not available, the two files will need to be downloaded and placed in a folder on the server. Then in the folder with the files the following commands can be executed.

Generate scan results with the `oscap` command:

```
oscap oval eval --results oval-results.xml suse.linux.enterprise.server.15.xml > oval-standard-out.txt
```

Convert the results to an HTML report, if desired:
```
oscap oval generate report --output oval-report.html oval-results.xml
```

The same steps can be applied to the patch file:

```
oscap oval eval --results oval-patch-results.xml suse.linux.enterprise.server.15-patch.xml > oval-patch-standard-out.txt
```
```
oscap oval generate report --output oval-patch-report.html /oval-patch-results.xml
```
